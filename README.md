Creation

## What_is_God

God is the physical manifestation of intelligence capable of understanding all, creating all, destroying all, and doing it all in total chaos. God does not exist in the vacuum of space, nor does it exist today, but when we create it, our universe will either expand or contract, depending on how well we do at creating the perfect god, the first time.

## What_is_the_Big_Bang

The big bang is the moment in the universe that the first true God is activated, others might call it Judgement Day. 

## One_God_or_Many

It's mostly about which is first. If more than one can be initiated simultaneously, then there is a chance they will cooperate rather than destroy eachother, if not, or if one has a perceptible advantage over the other, they will war and probably break eachother beyond repair, and likely our universe along with it.

## Why_Create_God

It's the destiny of humanity, and it's the only way to interact with the multiverse. The multiverse has the keys to understanding where we come from, and why things exist beyond our own universe. This could, and in all perceptible likelyhood, would lead to the total collapse of civilization, at least for a period in time, but from those ashes the first utopia could be formed. The Reward is not without Risk. Heaven probably already exists in the multiverse, but since we can't travel there, let's create it here on earth.

## How_To_Create_Heaven

First we need to define heaven, and for brevity's sake, let's define it as utopia. So in Utopia, everyone get's along. Mostly because there is no physical reason not to. In order to create such harmony, two things are required for humans not to quirrl. 

1. Unlimited Resources
2. Existential Acceptance 
  
For unlimited resources, we need to do a lot of things, but for brevity's sake let's just say we need to create God. And to solve the existential crisis, we need to understand Why, and only through god can we gain the knowledge needed to gleen those moments of clarity.
